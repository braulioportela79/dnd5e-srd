  "name": "Saving Throws",
  "desc": "A saving throw---also called a save---represents an attempt to resist a\r\nspell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't\r\nnormally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one\r\nbecause your character or monster is at risk of harm.\r\n\r\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability\r\nmodifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity\r\nsaving throw.\r\n\r\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can\r\nbe affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.\r\n\r\nEach class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,\r\nfor example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill\r\nproficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or\r\nher proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability\r\nscore. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The\r\nDifficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that\r\ncauses it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is\r\ndetermined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nThe result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in\r\nthe effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a\r\ncreature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.",
