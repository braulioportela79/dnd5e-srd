  "name": "Movement",
  "desc": "Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,\r\nscaling a treacherous mountain slope---all sorts of movement play a key\r\nrole in fantasy gaming adventures.\r\n\r\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact\r\ndistances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the\r\ndungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a\r\ndungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can\r\nsummarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at\r\nthe entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,\r\nwhich leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by\r\na narrow stone arch.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from\r\none spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes.\r\nThe rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed\r\nand travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving\r\nover.\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet\r\nthat the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes\r\nshort bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in\r\na minute, an hour, or a day.\r\n\r\n### Travel Pace\r\n\r\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or\r\nslow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far\r\nthe party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any\r\neffect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace\r\nmakes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\r\n\r\n**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel\r\nfor 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of\r\n`srd:exhaustion`.\r\n\r\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover\r\nthe distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character\r\nmust make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is\r\n10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character\r\nsuffers one level of `srd:exhaustion`.\r\n\r\n**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many\r\nanimals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at\r\na gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast\r\npace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can\r\ncover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in\r\ndensely populated areas.\r\n\r\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as\r\nnormal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of\r\nthe vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain\r\nbenefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the\r\ncrew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special\r\nvehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more\r\nswiftly.\r\n\r\n### Travel Pace\r\n\r\n**Distance Traveled per . . .**\r\n\r\n| Pace | Minute | Hour | Day | Effect |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |\r\n| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles | \\-\\-\\- |\r\n| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles | Able to use stealth |\r\n\r\n### Difficult Terrain\r\n\r\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively\r\nsimple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But\r\nadventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins,\r\nsteep mountains, and ice-covered ground---all considered difficult\r\nterrain.\r\n\r\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain---moving 1 foot in difficult\r\nterrain costs 2 feet of speed---so you can cover only half the normal\r\ndistance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\r\n\r\n## Special Types of Movement\r\n\r\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves\r\nmore than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim,\r\nor jump to get where they need to go.\r\n\r\n### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling\r\n\r\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2\r\nextra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or\r\nswimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface\r\nor one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)\r\ncheck. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a\r\nsuccessful Strength (Athletics) check.\r\n\r\n### Jumping\r\n\r\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\r\n\r\n**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up\r\nto your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately\r\nbefore the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only\r\nhalf that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a\r\nfoot of movement.\r\n\r\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a\r\njump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on\r\na DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller\r\nthan a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall.\r\nOtherwise, you hit it.\r\n\r\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10\r\nDexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land\r\n`srd:prone`.\r\n\r\n**High Jump.** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number\r\nof feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet\r\non foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,\r\nyou can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on\r\nthe jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might\r\nallow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you\r\nnormally can.\r\n\r\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the\r\njump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of\r\nthe jump plus 1½ times your height.",
