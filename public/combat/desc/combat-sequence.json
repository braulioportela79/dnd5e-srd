  "name": "The Order of Combat",
  "desc": "A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of\r\nweapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game\r\norganizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A\r\n**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round,\r\neach participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is\r\ndetermined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls\r\ninitiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the\r\nnext round if neither side has defeated the other.\r\n\r\n> **Combat Step by Step**\r\n>\r\n> 1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved\r\n>     in the combat encounter is surprised.\r\n> 2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters\r\n>     and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or\r\n>     their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM\r\n>     figures out where the adversaries areÌ¶ how far away and in what\r\n>     direction.\r\n> 3.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter\r\n>     rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.\r\n> 4.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in\r\n>     initiative order.\r\n> 5.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has\r\n>     had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting\r\n>     stops.\r\n\r\n**Surprise**\r\n\r\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the\r\ntrees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,\r\nunnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In\r\nthese situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\r\n\r\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be\r\nstealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM\r\ncompares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the\r\npassive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.\r\nAny character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at\r\nthe start of the encounter.\r\n\r\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn\r\nof the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A\r\nmember of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\r\n\r\nInitiative\r\n----------\r\n\r\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat\r\nstarts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their\r\nplace in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group\r\nof identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest\r\nDexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order\r\n(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The\r\ninitiative order remains the same from round to round.\r\n\r\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled\r\ncreatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.\r\nThe GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player\r\ncharacter. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters\r\neach roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\r\n\r\nYour Turn\r\n---------\r\n\r\nOn your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take\r\none action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action\r\nfirst. Your speed---sometimes called your walking speed---is noted on\r\nyour character sheet.\r\n\r\nThe most common actions you can take are described in\r\nsrd:actions-in-combat. Many class features and other abilities provide\r\nadditional options for your action.\r\n\r\nsrd:movement-and-position gives the rules for your move.\r\n\r\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your\r\nturn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the\r\nDodge or Ready action, as described in srd:actions-in-combat.\"\r\n\r\n### Bonus Actions\r\n\r\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an\r\nadditional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action\r\nfeature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can\r\ntake a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature\r\nof the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You\r\notherwise don't have a bonus action to take.\r\n\r\n### Other Activity on Your Turn\r\n\r\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your\r\naction nor your move.\r\n\r\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and\r\ngestures, as you take your turn.\r\n\r\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for\r\nfree, during either your move or your action. For example, you could\r\nopen a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could\r\ndraw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\r\n\r\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your\r\naction. Some magic items and other special objects always require an\r\naction to use, as stated in their descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities\r\nwhen it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For\r\ninstance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a\r\nstuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\r\n\r\nReactions\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a\r\nspecial action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a\r\ntrigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's.\r\nThe opportunity attack \\<srd:opportunity-attacks\\> is the most common\r\ntype of reaction.\r\n\r\nWhen you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of\r\nyour next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that\r\ncreature can continue its turn right after the reaction.",
