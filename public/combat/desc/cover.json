  "name": "Cover",
  "desc": "Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during\r\ncombat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit\r\nfrom cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the\r\nopposite side of the cover.\r\n\r\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources\r\nof cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees\r\naren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature\r\nthat gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover,\r\nthe target has three-quarters cover.\r\n\r\nA target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving\r\nthrows. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of\r\nits body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture,\r\na narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or\r\na friend.\r\n\r\nA target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and\r\nDexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about\r\nthree-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a\r\nportcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\r\n\r\nA target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or\r\na spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in\r\nan area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely\r\nconcealed by an obstacle.",
